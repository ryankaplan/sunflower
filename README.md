# Sunflower Spiral on the GPU

The Sunflower Spiral is the pattern that the seeds of a sunflower make as they spiral outward from its center.

This repo contains an implementation of a pixel shader that draws the sunflower spiral. It's quite a lot (~15x) faster than my naive CPU implementation which can be found [here](http://jsfiddle.net/k8vtg9br/1/).
